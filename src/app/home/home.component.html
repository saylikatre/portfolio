            Hi, I’m Sayli Katre, a fashion model and software engineer with a passion for creativity and innovation. 
            In the past several months, I’ve had the privilege of working with some of the most well-respected 
            choreographers and designers in the fashion industry. When I'm not coding or collaborating on exciting 
            fashion projects, you’ll often find me dancing or practicing yoga. These activities help me stay balanced 
            and energized, allowing me to approach both my career in tech and fashion with enthusiasm and grace.
          </p>
